    /* Inverse Relationships
     Relationships are unidirectional. Take our two classes, Category and Item. If Category.items links to an Item instance, you can follow the linl from Category to Item, but there's no way to go from an Item to its category object. You can set a one-to-one property, but those links are independent from one another. To solve this problem, Realm provides linking objects properties to represent Inverse Relationships.
